assumptions:
-   Bias model with flexible grid implementation
-   Compatible with Joachimi-Bridle IA framework

explanation: |
    "This module implements a flexible grid-based approach for intrinsic
    alignment modeling. It provides a more flexible framework for IA
    calculations that can accommodate various bias models and galaxy
    populations using grid-based interpolation methods."
