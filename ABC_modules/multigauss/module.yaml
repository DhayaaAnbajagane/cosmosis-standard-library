explanation: |
    "This module implements an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach
    for parameter calibration using a multi-Gaussian likelihood.
    
    The module reads a covariance matrix from file and generates ndata simulated
    data points from a multi-Gaussian distribution with means taken from the
    cosmological parameters mu0, mu1, etc. and the provided covariance.
    
    This is useful for ABC parameter estimation where direct likelihood
    computation is intractable but forward simulation is possible."
