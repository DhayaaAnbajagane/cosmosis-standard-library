explanation: |
    "This module implements a likelihood for COSEBIs (Complete Orthogonal Sets
    of E/B-Integrals) measurements. COSEBIs are a complete set of functions
    that can extract all E/B mode information from cosmic shear data while
    naturally separating E and B modes.
    
    The module compares theoretical COSEBIs predictions with observational
    data using a Gaussian likelihood approximation."
