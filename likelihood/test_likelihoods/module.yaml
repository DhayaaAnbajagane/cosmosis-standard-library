explanation: |
    "This module provides a collection of test likelihood functions that can
    be used for validation, testing, and demonstration purposes. These include:
    
    - Gaussian likelihood: Simple multi-dimensional Gaussian
    - Rosenbrock likelihood: Non-convex optimization test function  
    - Eggbox likelihood: Multi-modal test function
    - Multi-Gaussian likelihood: Mixture of Gaussians
    
    These are useful for testing sampling algorithms, pipeline configurations,
    and parameter estimation methods."
