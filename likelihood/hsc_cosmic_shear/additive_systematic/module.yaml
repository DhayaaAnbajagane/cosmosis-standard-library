assumptions:
-   Additive systematics can be modeled with simple parametric forms
-   Systematics are additive to the cosmic shear signal

explanation: |
    "This module models additive systematic errors for the Hyper Suprime-Cam
    (HSC) cosmic shear analysis. It implements parametric models for
    systematics that are added to the theoretical cosmic shear correlation
    functions to account for observational effects that are not captured
    by the standard cosmological model."
