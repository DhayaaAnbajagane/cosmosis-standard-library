assumptions:
-   Observable spectra can be computed from theoretical power spectra
-   Systematic effects can be included in the transformation

explanation: |
    "This module generates observable angular power spectra C_ell from
    theoretical power spectra, including the effects of observational
    systematics, masking, and other survey-specific effects.
    
    The module transforms theoretical predictions into the form that
    would actually be measured by a survey, accounting for factors
    like incomplete sky coverage, noise, and systematic errors."
